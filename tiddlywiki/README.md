This is a database tool intended to help writers to keep track of their submissions, publications they'd like to submit to, and the manuscripts that they would like to publish. 

I'm considering that this could be built in TiddlyWiki5, since it is lightweight and portable.

I am not a javascript pro, however, so this is all a learning experience for me.


## Features

This simple database is designed to help writers track three things, and details about them:

1. What have you written? ("manuscripts")
    - title
    - type
    - status
    - publication date
    - publication venue
    - a copy of the manuscript(s), as submitted
2. Where have you submitted? ("venues")
    - title
    - type
    - contact info.  
    - submission guideline details
3. What is the status of those submissions?
    - how long have they been out?
    - which manuscripts have been sent to which venues?
    - (poets) include multiple manuscripts as part of a single submission?
