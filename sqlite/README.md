This is a tool intended to help writers (or other creatives) to keep track of their submissions, venues they'd like to submit to, and the works that they would like to publish. 

**This version is a database file for use with SQLite**. You'll need to [install SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html) at least and may also prefer a graphical interface such as [SQLiteMan](http://sqliteman.com/) which is free software available for [Windows, Linux](http://sqliteman.com/page/4.html) and [Mac](http://brewformulas.org/Sqliteman).

I'm ask experimenting with Kexi as a front-end for this database. I'll share any findings.
